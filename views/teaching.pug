  p As part of my academic duties I have served as teaching assistant, tutor or #[i esercitatore] to several courses. I have left here some of the information of the #[a(href="#current") current] running courses as well as #[a(href="#past") past] materials that can be of usage.
  p I've also served as co-supervisor for several master and graduate thesis', some of which are also listed #[a(href="#tesine") below].
  p I have also participated in several science outreach activities both in #[a(href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/outreach/saturdaymorning/") Durham] and as part of the #[a(href="https://higgstools.org/WP6") Higgstools] network.
