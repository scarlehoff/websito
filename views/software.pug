  p I am passionate about software development and open source code. During my academic carreers I have been involved on the development of many tools with a focus on numerical calculations.
  p You can find #[a(href="#osource") here] some of the open software I have developed or contributed to develop in the last few years. Some of them are research tools, some are personal projects I have done in my spare time.
  p I have #[a(href="#pastwork") listed] some of the software development work I have been involved with in the past. This includes my work as as a researcher in different research group as well as my work outside academia.

  p Familyapp. It was featured in the #[a(href="https://www.europapress.es/portaltic/internet/noticia-familyapp-web-solidaria-descuentos-donaciones-ong-20140915135251.html") news]. The project died out but some of it can still be accessed through the #[a(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140914195450/http://www.familyapp.es/") wayback] machine.

  p NNLOJET. A parton-level monte carlo generator written in Fortran. I have work on the implementation of the Higgs production process through gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. The codebase is mostly private, with an aim of making it public in the future. The code is built so that the computation can easily be distributed among different systems. The implementation of the Vegas algorithm that fuels the integration is based on the code that can be found in this github #[a(href="https://github.com/scarlehoff/vegasSocket") repository].

  p Shell Projects & Technology Rijswijk. As part of an internship I was part of the Projects and Tehcnology branch of Shell, where I worked on the geophysical tomography imaging tool #[a(href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/overcoming-technology-challenges/finding-oil-and-gas/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1519763871115/bb09c37973c5a21a00f9e95015f705e1dae794cf/geophysical-imaging-brochure-2014.pdf") SIPMAP].
