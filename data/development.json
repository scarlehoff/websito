The codebase is mostly private, with an aim of making it public in the future. The code is built so that the computation can easily be distributed among different systems. The implementation of the Vegas algorithm that fuels the integration is based on the code that can be found in this github <a href='https://github.com/scarlehoff/vegasSocket'>repository</a>"
