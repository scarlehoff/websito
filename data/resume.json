    "C++" : "I've worked with C++ at several points of my career. My master thesis Monte Carlo code was written in C++, as well as supporting code for my PhD thesis and at the internship at Shell. I've also been Teaching Assistant for the C++ course of the University of Milano.",
    "python" : "Most of my work nowadays is developed using python, be it under the umbrella of the NNPDF collaboration or other research projects such as Vegasflow and evolutionary-keras. The backbone of the familyapp system, in which I worked before starting my PhD was also written using python (using django). I have also some personal projects written in python available in my github.",
